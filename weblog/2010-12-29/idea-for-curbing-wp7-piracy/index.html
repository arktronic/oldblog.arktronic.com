        <p>Since it has been made <a href="http://www.wpcentral.com/windows-phone-marketplace-app-security-cracked-proof-of-concept-video">painfully obvious</a> that Windows Phone 7 application piracy is possible, at least for developer unlocked devices, it's about time I outlined a fairly simple idea I had a couple of months back about curbing such piracy for a significant subset of the WP7 apps out there.</p>
<p>First, the tl;dr version is as follows: <strong>Microsoft should provide an API to get (or verify) app purchasers' anonymized Live IDs and/or Device Unique IDs.</strong></p>
<p>Now, the explanation. Whenever a user purchases an app via the Marketplace, they must do so through their Live ID. Because their Live ID is associated to the app purchase, there should be a one-to-one relationship between a single app purchase and a Live ID. Assuming that the anonymized Live IDs (ANIDs) that are already available to app developers can be determined/calculated by Microsoft's services in the cloud, then all Microsoft has to do is expose an API that lets app developers check whether the current user's ANID is associated with a verified purchase.</p>
<p>The reason I said earlier that this would apply to a subset of apps and not all of them is that such a validity check should only be performed server-side -- otherwise, an app that performs it locally can easily be cracked to NOP (ignore) the code performing this check. Because of this, only apps that rely on a cloud service would gain a significant benefit from doing ANID validity checking. And the reason I used the term &quot;significant&quot; is that Microsoft has already been pushing for more cloud functionality within apps, so the encouragement is already there to some extent.</p>
<p>Finally, if ANIDs cannot be calculated by Microsoft outside of the phone, then the same idea would still apply to Device Unique IDs. Since a check is already being done to ensure that an app is not installed on more than five (I believe) devices associated with a single Live ID, Microsoft has to already be storing all active Device IDs per Live ID. Exposing an API to check for the validity of a Device ID based on its parent Live ID would provide the same benefit.</p>
