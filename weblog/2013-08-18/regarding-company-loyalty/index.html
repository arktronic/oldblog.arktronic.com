        <p>Doing some evening web surfing, I came across an intriguing Reddit post entitled &quot;<a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1kmkwy/dont_be_loyal_to_your_company/">Don't be loyal to your company</a>&quot; that pointed to <a href="http://www.heartmindcode.com/blog/2013/08/loyalty-and-layoffs/">a blog post</a>. The blog is currently offline, probably due to the Reddit traffic, but a <a href="http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:qRMCnAJE2UoJ:www.heartmindcode.com/blog/2013/08/loyalty-and-layoffs/&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=uk&amp;strip=1">Google cache of the post</a> exists. After reading that post, I felt a visceral need to respond, so that's what I'm doing now.</p>
<p>The author of the aforementioned blog post essentially claims that a corporation does not deserve loyalty because it cannot be loyal to you and will <em>necessarily</em> let you go if doing so increases its bottom line; that the CEO's mandate is to make just those kinds of decisions; and that you have to take control of your career lest you be shackled to an oar (his words). I don't disagree with any of these points. But I do disagree with the overall message and the moral of the story, as it were.</p>
<p>The message should, in my opinion, be to choose your place of employment wisely. That blog post pretty much summed up the reasons why I generally dislike big, soulless corporations. But there are other options out there! I currently work at a ~100 person consulting company. Previously, I was at a &lt;10 person consulting company. And before that I was at university, but during that time I did briefly work at a fairly large insurance company. I got a taste of the large company ethos then, and it was enough to scare me away.</p>
<p>Smaller companies are different. They place more value in the individual. There's little, if any, company politics and bureaucracy. And I think, for the most part, people are happier there. If I were to look at things more cynically, I could say that smaller companies have more incentive to keep employees happy because the loss of one employee at a 50-person company is more painful than the loss of one employee at a 50,000-person company. But I choose not to look at it that way.</p>
<p>I think the reason I felt such a strong need to respond to the blog post in question is that it hits home on some level. I believe that if I were in that author's shoes, having gone through his experiences, I could be just as jaded as he is. In a sense, I'm lucky to have had the chance to see that environment early on and seek opportunities elsewhere. People who know me have seen how cynical I can be about certain topics. But the topic of company loyalty is an exception. I truly believe that it is possible to find a company that isn't soulless, that does in fact care about its employees, and that can even deserve loyalty.</p>
